- [x] Update `SongListItem` in `LibraryScreen.kt` to accept `showCover: Boolean = true` and `showArtist: Boolean = true`.

    - Calculate the intersection of artists for all songs in the album.
    - If the intersection is non-empty, use it as the subtitle.
    - If all songs in the album share the exact same set of artists (equal to the intersection), set `showSongArtist = false`.
    - Set `showSongCover = false`.
- [x] Verify `ArtistDetailScreen`, `PlaylistDetailScreen`, and `FolderDetailScreen` still work correctly (passing default `true` values implicit or explicit).
- [x] Add `various_artists` string resource.
- [x] Refactor `LocalMusicSource.getAlbumList` to aggregate from `MediaStore.Audio.Media` (Songs) instead of `MediaStore.Audio.Albums`.
    - Apply `excludedFolders` filter (fixing a hidden bug).
    - Group by `ALBUM_ID`.
    - Calculate artist intersection for each album.
    - If intersection is empty, use "Various Artists".
